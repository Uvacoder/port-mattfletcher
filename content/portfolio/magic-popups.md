# Magic Popups
Magic Popups is a WordPress plugin which allows you to easily add lightweight and customizable popups to your WordPress site. This was my first 'official' WordPress plugin, and got approved to appear in their <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/magic-popups-customizable-and-lightweight/" target="_blank">plugin repository</a>.

I originally started this project to test the water with using Vue 3 to develop WordPress plugins. It took some configuration, but I finally got it working with relatively good developer experience. 

The plugin provides these features:

- Choose which pages the popup is displayed on.
- Choose how often a user sees each popup (daily, weekly, etc).
- Set an opening delay, ensuring your popup does not appear instantly.
- Set a title and description.
- Add a custom button with a URL.
