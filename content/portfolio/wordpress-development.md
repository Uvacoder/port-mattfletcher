# WordPress Websites
I have designed and developed several WordPress websites outside of work hours. These projects usually consist of

- Creating the design using Figma and then converting the design to markup.
- Ahdering to SEO best practices to ensure her organic search engine results are good.
- Fully flexible themes which allow clients to create and build their own pages / posts.
- Regularly organzing meetings to ensure their websites exceeds their expectations. 

I still main these websites, but due to their flexibility they do not require much of my time. Please see a couple of websites I have created below:

## Maria Hocking
