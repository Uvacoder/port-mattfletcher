I designed and developed this Wordpress website for Maria Hocking outside of work hours.
Maria is a Life Coach, Motivational Speaker and Author and has an active blog on her website.

- Created the design using Figma and then converted the design to markup.
- Adhered to SEO best practices to ensure her organic search engine results are good.
- Created custom Wordpress theme with lots of flexibility in the back office.
- Regularly organized meetings with Maria to ensure her website exceeds her expectations. 
- I still maintain this website, but due to the themes flexibility, Maria does not need me often.
