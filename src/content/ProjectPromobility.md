I designed and developed this Wordpress website for Pro Mobility outside of work hours.
Pro Mobility's main objective is to provide a friendly service to its customers. They offer a wide range of mobility products at affordable prices and have a loyal customer base covering Cornwall.

- Created the design using figma and then converted the deisgn to markup.
- Adhered to SEO best practies to ensure her organic search engine results are good.
- Created custom Wordpress theme with lots of flexability in the back office.
- Reguarly organized meetings with Promobility to ensure their website exceeds their expectations. 
- I still maintain this website, but due to the flexability of the theme, they does not need me often.
