This project required me to write a scientific research paper
on a topic related to Computer Science. I decided to write 
about Quantum Computing since this topic interests me.
Although report writing is not my favourite task,
this is my best-written work received a strong First.

### Report Snippet
The concept of a quantum computer evolved out of the issues raised by Richard Feynman in 
1982 in his paper entitled Computer Simulations of Physics, which ponders the question “Can 
we simulate physics on a computer?”. He addressed several issues associated with 
conventional computer simulations of physics, most notably quantum physics and the need 
to improve methods for representing large amounts of electrons in different states. Feynman 
argued that although simulating physics on a traditional machine is theoretically possible, it is 
impractical due to the computing cost rising exponentially as the simulation grows in size 
(Feynman, 1982). Therefore, Feynman proposed that to replicate real-world physics, we would 
need to design a machine “of a different kind”, a quantum programmable machine that could 
imitate the laws of quantum mechanics, namely a quantum computer. 

The term quantum supremacy was born out of Feynman’s ideas. The Google A.I. team states 
that the realisation of quantum supremacy is when a quantum computer provides a dramatic 
increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms (Arute et al., 2019). However, IBM 
states that quantum supremacy is achieved when a quantum computer has solved a problem 
that classical computers cannot solve (Palan et al., 2019). Thus, Google A.I. asserts that 
quantum supremacy is defined by benchmarking against conventional computers. In contrast,
IBM asserts that it occurs when a quantum computer can perform tasks that a conventional 
computer cannot. IBM’s definition seems to correlate better with Feynman’s original proposal 
that a quantum programmable machine would be required to simulate the quantum world. 
For this paper, it is assumed that quantum supremacy is achieved when quantum computers 
progress past intriguing scientific endeavours and begin performing tasks that classical 
computers are incapable of performing or are incapable of performing quickly enough for 
practical applications.

This paper will begin by providing context for some of the concepts underlying quantum 
computing and how it operates. Following that, a debate will occur about what the team 
headed by the Google A.I. has achieved and whether or not their claim of reaching quantum 
supremacy with their Sycamore processor is valid since they received a large amount of 
criticism from IBM. The paper will provide a section discussing the prospects of quantum 
computing, whether it will eventually replace classical computers or supplement them [...]
