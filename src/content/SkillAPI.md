Structuring APIs is important to me. The structure must allow the end-user to consume it without confusion. This is why I usually follow REST protocol and provide documentation with Swagger. 

The GitHub repo for the API I build for my Interactive Map project can be <a href="https://github.com/mattfletcher94/interactive-map-api" target="_blank">found here</a>

I have built REST APIs in Node, Net and PHP, with Node being my preferred choice.
