Node is my preferred choice for server-side development. I have used Node in conjunction with Express and MongoDB to build high-quality REST APIs. In addition, I have experience with real-time connections by using web sockets to drive an online multiplayer game. I encourage Typescript, especially within server applications, since this allows me to put my OOP and SOLID design principles into practice.
