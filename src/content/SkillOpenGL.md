I have experience in rendering high-performance 2D graphics using WebGL and Pixi.js. The front-end of my <a href="https://youtu.be/Hku3ORswnwE" target="_blank">university dissertation</a> and my <a href="https://youtu.be/hVRlS9BiE78?t=83" target="_blank">online 2D shooter game</a>, both of which received strong firsts, used these technologies.

Another project at the university involved using C++ and shaders to render 3D graphics. My project was a world generator that allows you to create a small and simple world by providing a grey-scale heightmap and an RGB blend map. This project received an impressive first and was a fantastic learning experience. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/mattfletcher94/opengl-world-generator" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.
