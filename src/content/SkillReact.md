I understand the advantages of React. Its simplicity and the way it integrates with Typescript cannot be faulted.

During my current employment, I introduced the company to React and now spend much of my time working with it. This includes the development of component libraries and web applications for our customers. I often use Next.js, which gives me access to a server when I need to hide API keys.

Outside of work, I experimented with React Native, a hybrid mobile app framework. I thought the workflow was relatively simple, but I found Flutter to be a much stronger framework.
