My passion lies in building slick and modern user interfaces that offer a wonderful experience for the end-user. We have designers at my current employment, but often I will be trusted to design UI components, such as filter systems and back-office screens. In addition, I offer opinions and solutions on how we can improve the user experience. The projects shown throughout this website are designed by me. Lately, I have been working hard to improve my design work by practising in Figma.
