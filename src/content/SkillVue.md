Due to its simplicity and scalability, Vue is my preferred choice of front-end frameworks. 

The front-end for my <a href="https://youtu.be/Hku3ORswnwE" target="_blank">university dissertation</a> and my <a href="https://youtu.be/hVRlS9BiE78?t=82" target="_blank">online 2D shooter game</a>, both of which received strong firsts, was developed with Vue.

This portfolio website was also developed with Vue 3 and was my first experience with Vite. I have found Vite much faster and easier to use than Webpack and will continue to use it for future projects. This website uses the Vite SSG plugin to render a high-performance static website.

I introduced and encouraged the use of Vue and Nuxt in my current employment, and used them to develop their self-sign-up process for their booking system, increasing their enrolment by 300%.

Since the release of Vue 3, my passion for Vue has grown. The composition API and the setup script have made Vue delightful to work with. My current side project, Diagramming.io, uses these new Vue 3 features.
