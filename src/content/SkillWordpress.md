I have over 5 years of experience with Wordpress with a strong understanding of the WordPress core. I have built over 20 custom themes with intuitive back offices and modern front-ends, many of which are viewed by thousands of visitors every day. In my current employment, I have also developed a Wordpress Saas product with over 15 paid subscribers.

Wordpress development has greatly improved my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
